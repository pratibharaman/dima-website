          <p>
            Hi there! My name is Dima Thabit, and I am a pediatric occupational
            therapist based in Brooklyn, New York. I have over 9 years of
            experience supporting children from early intervention (ages 1–3)
            through school-aged and high school years, working with children
            with a wide range of strengths, needs, and learning styles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in supporting children with differences related to
            autism, ADHD, sensory processing, emotional regulation, and mental
            health, while partnering closely with families to help children feel
            understood, confident, and successful in their daily lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            My practice is rooted in a strengths-based, family- and
            child-centered approach and emphasizes neuro-affirming care. I
            believe therapy should honor each child's individuality while
            empowering parents with tools, understanding, and confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I earned my Master's degree from Boston University and continue to
            engage in ongoing professional development. My training includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Learn Play Thrive approach to autism</li>
            <li>Kelly Mahler's Interoception Curriculum</li>
            <li>Play therapy and attachment-centered interventions</li>
            <li>
              Support for emotional regulation, trauma, ADHD/ADD, and mental
              health challenges
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I value collaboration with families and other professionals and
            strive to create a supportive, playful, and respectful therapeutic
            environment where children can thrive. If you're wondering whether
            occupational therapy could support your child or family, I'd be
            happy to connect.
          </p>
