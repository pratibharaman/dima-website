          <p>
            Occupational therapy evaluations are required to initiate services,
            unless a recent assessment (within one month) has already been
            completed by a qualified occupational therapist.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sessions are 45–90 minutes</li>
            <li>Written report provided within 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Includes standardized and non-standardized assessments</li>
            <li>Caregiver interview included</li>
            <li>
              Caregivers may be asked to complete forms related to their child's
              strengths and needs
            </li>

            Sessions are provided in your home and/or community setting
            (library, playground) and are designed to meet your child where they
            are. Using a family-centered, neuro-affirming approach, therapy
            focuses on building skills that support your child's everyday
            participation and independence.
          </p>
          <p>Interventions are individualized and may address:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Self-regulation and emotional regulation</li>
            <li>Gross motor skills</li>
            <li>Fine motor and hand skills</li>
            <li>Visual-motor integration</li>
            <li>Pre-writing and handwriting skills</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Sessions are play-based, strengths-focused, and tailored to your
            child's unique needs. Caregivers are expected to be active partners
            in the therapy process and are supported with practical strategies
            to use between sessions.
