            In addition to being an incredibly effective OT provider, Dima also
            has a wonderful, bubbly personality that my son just adored. He was
            always so excited to start his sessions with her!

            Dima was incredibly helpful at determining what my son's sensory
            needs were, and how we could help him regulate his emotions
            throughout the day.

            One of our goals was to help my son use utensils more effectively.
            Dima worked with my son at the dinner table, and provided me with
            clear instructions and activities I could work on with him outside
            of his therapy sessions. I'm happy to say that my son can now use a
            fork and spoon perfectly!

            Dima is a talented therapist who has a beautiful way with our son
            and a razor sharp mind that combines intuition with a deep clinical
            understanding. We are so lucky to have her on our team!
